      <p>
        The 1965 war ended without a clear victor, but its consequences were far-reaching. 
        Pakistan’s hopes for a decisive political and territorial gain remained unfulfilled, 
        while India restored its confidence after the 1962 setback with China.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Tashkent Agreement brought peace but not closure. 
        The sudden death of Indian Prime Minister <b>Lal Bahadur Shastri</b> in Tashkent 
        added mystery and tension to the aftermath.
      </p>

      <p>
        In Pakistan, the return from Tashkent marked the beginning of deep political rifts. 
        <b>Zulfikar Ali Bhutto</b> emerged as a populist leader, challenging 
        President <b>Ayub Khan’s</b> policies and paving the way for a new political era.
